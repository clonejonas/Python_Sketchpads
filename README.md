# Python-Sketchpads
This is a collection of Python project/sketchpads.<br/>
Here you will find most of the code that I create for tutorial purposes.<br/>
Each sketchpad revolves around a different topic.<br/>
Most of this is just for visualization purposes. <br/>
These are meant to be learning/tutorial tools.<br/>

I have written articles that correspond with some of these files.<br/>
Here are some links:<br/>
